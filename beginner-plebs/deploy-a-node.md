#### How to Set an Alias and Color for Your Node

Personalizing your node makes it easier for your node to be identified by others. You can give it a name and a color that shows up when your node is viewed using external applications, such as [1ml](https://1ml.com/) and [graph.kycjelly.com](http://graph.kycjelly.com/).

In order to do this, you will need to access your node via the command line terminal using SSH. If you're using Umbrel/LND, use [these instructions](https://lightningwiki.net/index.php/Setting_alias_and_color_for_Umbrel).

If you're familiar with the Linux command line, you'll find this step very simple. [You can view a cheat sheet of common Linux commands here](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html).

Important note: Whenever you update your node's software, you will need to reset these settings, so you should take note of the these settings for reference. \(Do not overwrite the new lnd.conf with your old version, just update those specific lines.\)
