# Node Monitoring

## Lightning Watch Bot

One simple way to be notified in the event your node becomes unavailable is to register it with @lightningwatchbot, a Telegram bot that will keep an eye on your node's up/down staus. Start a conversation with the bot, and it will walk you through the steps to connect your node. As a free service, it will send you alerts on a one hour delay. For a faster response time, you can open a channel of any size with the bot \(a great way to practice opening channels\) and send it a small payment to receive notifications for your desired duration.
