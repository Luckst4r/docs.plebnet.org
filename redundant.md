Umbrel is too weak for what I am looking for. The goal of this project is

- Provide redundancy across locales, and devices
- More resource friendly
- ✨Magic ✨

## TODO
- Install Cyphernode
- Install Specter wallet
- Make wasabi front end interface
- Get TOR working
- C-lightning support
- LND support
- B.O.S. support by default
- Containerize the whole thing to make it dumb easy to install
